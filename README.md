# Indoor Delivery Robots for Real-World Stores

Cheaper, faster, and more reliable indoor delivery—built for doors, elevators, and human spaces.

## The problem we solve

Do you have a workforce shortage in your company?. Drones and wheeled robots aren’t a practical option indoors; humanoid robots are. Our system automates indoor hand-offs so orders move quicker with lower cost and higher reliability.

## What we’re building

A humanoid indoor delivery robot based on Unitree G1 with RGB-D + LiDAR + IMU sensor fusion, an advanced hybrid gripper with standardized crates, and edge compute (Jetson Orin, ROS2/Nav2/MoveIt2). Dispatch and verification run through our logistics app with QR/biometric checks.

## Why it matters (unit economics)

Operating cost from \~290 ₽/hour vs. \~630 ₽/hour for human couriers. Per-robot monthly savings \~160,000 ₽ with an estimated payback in \~3 years.;

## People feedbacks

* We’ve gathered feedback from 100+ clients of marketplaces and grocery stores to refine flows and acceptance.

## Where it works first

* Inside-store replenishment & back-room ↔️ front-of-house movements
* Pickup-point automation and hand-offs
* Obstacle-dense last-meter routes that stump wheeled bots.

## Status & roadmap

Our software works in simulation, and we already test on real robots.

## Call to action

Pilot with us. If you run dense indoor flows (pickup points, micro-fulfillment, or inside-store logistics), let’s cut costs and raise throughput together.
